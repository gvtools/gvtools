Introduction
============

The gvtools project aims to provide a Desktop GIS application that offers the gvSIG user interface backed by
well known libraries, mainly Geotools.

This project is started by us, the gvSIG CE team, with the aim to obtain a more stable version of gvSIG that is
backed by well known libraries, mainly Geotools. This will allow us to reduce the efforts to
maintain the software and, at the same time, to learn from a well established community on technical
and organizational aspects.

On the other side, we look forward to have an opportunity to contribute back to Geotools or any other library
in use.
